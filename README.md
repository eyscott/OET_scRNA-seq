# The optoelectronic microrobot: A versatile toolbox for micromanipulation
Using optoelectronic tweezers (OET) to gently isolate and manipulate cells in suspension

## General Workflow
This RNA-seq pipeline works through normalizing then comparing transcriptomes from varying numbers of U87 (human glioblastoma) or B16 (mouse melanoma) cells isolated using OET.
Provided scripts were used to generate figures using heatmap.2, ggplot2 and UMAP
